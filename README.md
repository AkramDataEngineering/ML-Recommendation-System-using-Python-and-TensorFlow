# ML-Recommendation-System-using-Python-and-TensorFlow
# 🎯 Recommendation System with Python & TensorFlow

**Project:** Build a content-based recommendation system using content metadata and embeddings.  
**Goal:** Given a title (e.g. *Wednesday*), recommend similar shows/movies using only content features (no user-event history).

---

## 📌 Overview & Motivation (more detailed)
Recommendation systems power platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Spotify. They can be **collaborative** (use user interactions) or **content-based** (use item metadata).  
This project demonstrates a **content-based, deep-learning approach** using TensorFlow embeddings. It’s useful when user interaction data is sparse or unavailable — e.g., new streaming services, catalogs, or cold-start items. The model maps titles, languages, and content types into a dense vector space where *similar items are nearby*, enabling fast and interpretable recommendations.

---

## 📦 Dataset (Netflix-style content)
Typical columns used in this project:
- `Title` — content name  
- `Available Globally?` — flag (optional)  
- `Release Date` — temporal info (optional)  
- `Hours Viewed` — popularity signal (cleaned numeric)  
- `Language Indicator` — categorical (e.g., EN, ES)  
- `Content Type` — categorical (Movie, Series, Documentary)  

> The dataset is ideal for content-based filtering without user interactions.

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (explain why)
1. **Clean numeric fields** (e.g., remove commas from `Hours Viewed`) — enables numeric training signals.  
2. **Deduplicate & drop missing titles** — prevents noisy embeddings.  
3. **Create content IDs** — integer IDs are required for embedding layers.  
4. **Encode categorical fields** (language, content type) as integer codes — these feed the embedding layers.  
5. **Optional features**: normalized `Hours Viewed`, release-year bucket, genre multi-hot vectors — enrich embedding context.

Why this matters: embeddings require integer indices; careful cleaning ensures embeddings reflect real semantic signals (popularity, language, and type).

## 🧠 Model Architecture (detailed explanation)
We use a small neural network with embedding layers:

- **Inputs**
  - `content_id` (index)
  - `language_id`
  - `content_type_id`
- **Embeddings**
  - `content_embedding` → e.g., 32D (learns content relationships)
  - `language_embedding` → e.g., 8D (captures language similarity)
  - `type_embedding` → e.g., 4D (captures content-type similarity)
- **Dense layers**
  - Concatenate flattened embeddings → Dense(64, relu) → Dense(32, relu)
- **Output**
  - Dense(num_contents, softmax) — self-supervised target to reconstruct/predict content_id

Why embeddings? They compress high-cardinality categorical features into continuous vectors where similar items cluster. That enables nearest-neighbour-style recommendations in vector space.

---

## 🚂 Training Strategy (why & how)
- **Self-supervised approach**: target is `Content_ID`. The model learns to predict items given their metadata. This structures the embedding space even without user labels.
- **Loss & optimizer**: `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` with `Adam`.  
- **Batching & epochs**: moderate epochs (5–20) and batch sizes (32–128) depending on dataset size and GPU memory.  
- **Normalization**: if using numeric features (hours viewed), scale them (StandardScaler/MinMax).

Trade-off: softmax over all items can be expensive for very large catalogs — consider sampled softmax or metric-learning (contrastive/Triplet loss) for scale.

---

## 🔎 Inference & Recommendation (how it works)
1. Lookup the item's `content_id`, `language_id`, `content_type_id`.  
2. Predict the softmax vector from the model for that input.  
3. Take top-k indices (excluding the query item) → map to titles.  
4. Optionally re-rank by `Hours Viewed` or business rules.

Because the model learns embeddings, you can also:
- Extract embeddings and run **nearest neighbour (FAISS, Annoy)** search for faster retrieval.
- Use cosine similarity on embedding vectors to find similar content.

---

## ✅ Evaluation & Limitations
**Evaluation options**
- Proxy metrics: does the model cluster known related titles?  
- Retrieval metrics (if you have ground-truth pairs): Precision@k, Recall@k, MAP.  
- Human evaluation: small user study for perceived relevance.

**Limitations**
- Without user interactions, personalization is limited.  
- Model may capture popularity & metadata bias (e.g., language dominance).  
- Softmax over many contents is expensive — consider metric learning for very large catalogs.

---

## 🚀 Production Considerations
- **Embeddings export**: save embedding matrix; use approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) for low-latency retrieval.  
- **Cold start for new items**: quickly infer embedding from metadata; no retraining required if model generalizes.  
- **Hybridization**: combine content embeddings with collaborative signals (when available) for full personalization.  
- **A/B testing**: measure recommendation impact on engagement.
